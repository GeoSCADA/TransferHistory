# TransferHistory
This program is a Geo SCADA Utility for exporting and importing historic data.
Files are exported to tab-separated text files, one per point.
You can select the points to be exported from the list - use shift or ctrl to select multiple points.
The point selection is saved between runs, as are the date/time, folder and user name. The password is not saved.
When importing the whole folder is searched for files containing data and with file names matching point names.
