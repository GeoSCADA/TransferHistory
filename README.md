Sample code of data export tools using the ClearSCADA / Geo SCADA APIs.

This is offered as source code which you can build with Visual 
Studio. It is not supported or warranted in any way by Schneider Electric.

The source code is available for you to freely use, modify and extend to 
suit your requirements or that of your clients. It is perhaps not the 
most optimized, efficient or elegant code but we hope that its simplicity 
will encourage engagement with Geo SCADA.

This program is a Geo SCADA Utility for exporting and importing historic data.
Files are exported to tab-separated text files, one per point.
You can select the points to be exported from the list - use shift or ctrl to select multiple points.
The point selection is saved between runs, as are the date/time, folder and user name. The password is not saved.
When importing the whole folder is searched for files containing data and with file names matching point names.
